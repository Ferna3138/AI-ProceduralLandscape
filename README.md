## Overview

The **Procedural Infinite Terrain Generator** is a Unity project that dynamically generates an infinite terrain using Perlin noise and object pooling techniques. The terrain seamlessly extends in all directions as the player moves, creating an immersive open-world experience.

## Features

âœ… **Procedural Generation** â€“ Uses Perlin noise to create natural-looking terrain.

âœ… **Infinite Scrolling Terrain** â€“ New terrain chunks generate dynamically as the player moves.

âœ… **Level of Detail (LOD) Optimization** â€“ Reduces complexity based on distance.

âœ… **Multithreading Support** â€“ Improves performance by generating terrain on separate threads.

âœ… **Customizable Terrain Settings** â€“ Adjust height maps, scale, and frequency.

âœ… **Deterministic Terrain** â€“ Chunks are deterministic: If you move far enough and then come back, the original chunk will remain unchanged.

## How It Works

### Terrain Generation
- The terrain is divided into chunks.
- Each chunk is generated using Perlin noise for realistic elevation.
- As the player moves, new chunks are spawned while distant chunks are removed or reused.

### Performance Optimization
- **Object Pooling:** Prevents frequent memory allocation by reusing terrain chunks.
- **Multithreading:** Terrain generation runs on a separate thread to prevent frame drops.
- **LOD System:** Reduces detail on distant terrain for better performance.
